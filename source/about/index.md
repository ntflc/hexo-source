Hi! My name is **Lichao Fei** (aka **@ntflc** elsewhere).

I am currently a Software Development Engineer in Test. I was a former HTC custom ROMs developer, and a moderator for the HTC One (M8) and HTC One M9 sections on Gfan forum (机锋论坛).

This blog primarily features tutorials and resources related to mobile device firmware flashing, software testing-related content, digital product discussions, as well as some personal essays.

You can reach out to me via Weibo [@越昂超英](https://weibo.com/feilichao) or through email <ntflc.bit@gmail.com>.
