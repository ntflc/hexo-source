Due to my passion for mobile devices, I dedicated a period to developing custom ROMs for HTC smartphones. However, for various reasons, I eventually discontinued this endeavor.  I previously served as a moderator for the HTC One (M8) and HTC One M9 sections on Gfan forum (机锋论坛).

This blog primarily features tutorials and resources related to mobile device firmware flashing, software testing-related content, digital product discussions, as well as some personal essays.
